  Web page displayes "real" overvalued player and most "real" undervalued players based
  upon the sabermetric methodologies used. But maybe this takes away some of the leagues players
  potential for a possible player to develop a query for something like that. 
  
  Web page displayes players with most increasing and decreasing value. Just throwing
  out ideas here. 
  
  Also maybe a section for possible minor league players that might be coming up soon 
  and have the ability to make a solid contribution to ones fantasy team. Not sure if we
  could get that to work thought because of all their stats being on milb.com but maybe we could 
  have some weekly manual posts where we have a minor league watch list. 
  
  Thats about all the major ones I could think of to add on. I'm sure like Zach said as we
  go on and build this we can add in some various minor features we come up with.
